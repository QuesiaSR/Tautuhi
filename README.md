# Tautuhi

Simple cape mod for people who don't have a migrator cape, or for the lazy people.

### This mod does NOT require FabricAPI

# How to use

Put your cape texture in `.minecraft/config`. The name of the file must be `cape.png` and must be of the PNG format.
Use an online converter if it's not PNG format, because you can't just rename it (it will think it's corrupted).
The size of the cape texture must be `64x32`, can't be bigger, can't be smaller.

Example texture (you can use this to test out the mod).

<img src="./cape.png" alt="..." />

The texture will update every time you join a world, so there's no need to restart your game.
